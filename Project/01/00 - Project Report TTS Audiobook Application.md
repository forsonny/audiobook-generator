## Final Project Report: TTS Audiobook Application

**Introduction**

This document outlines the development and features of the TTS Audiobook Application, designed to convert text-based books into engaging audiobooks using advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. The application prioritizes user experience by offering features such as customizable voice selection, playback speed control, and offline access to generated audiobooks.

**Core Functionality**

The application's primary function is to transform digital text into spoken audio. This is achieved through a sophisticated pipeline that involves:

1.  **Text Ingestion:** The system supports various input formats, including plain text, EPUB, and PDF files. It intelligently extracts the textual content, preserving the structure and formatting where possible.
2.  **Text Processing:** Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed to analyze the text. This includes sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and identifying dialogue versus narration. This detailed analysis allows for more natural and expressive audio rendering.
3.  **Voice Synthesis:** The core TTS engine, in this case, Kokoro TTS, is utilized to convert the processed text into high-quality audio. Users can select from a range of voices and adjust parameters like speed and pitch to customize the listening experience.
4.  **Audio Output:** The generated audio is then presented to the user in a standard audio format (e.g., MP3, WAV) that can be played on various devices. The application also supports features like bookmarking and chapter navigation for enhanced usability.

**Key Features**

*   **Multi-Format Support:** Ingests text from various file formats, including .txt, .epub, and .pdf.
*   **Advanced Text Analysis:** Utilizes NLP for accurate text segmentation and dialogue detection.
*   **Customizable Voice Output:** Offers a selection of voices and allows users to adjust speed and pitch.
*   **Offline Access:** Generated audiobooks can be downloaded and listened to offline.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with ease of use in mind, ensuring a smooth user experience.

**Technical Architecture**

The application is built using a modular architecture, which includes:

*   **Frontend:** Developed using modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and potentially packaged as a desktop application using Electron for cross-platform compatibility.
*   **Backend:** Python is used for its robust text processing capabilities and integration with TTS engines like Kokoro TTS. Libraries such as NLTK or spaCy may be used for NLP tasks.
*   **Data Storage:** User preferences, project files, and generated audiobooks are stored locally or in a cloud-based storage solution, depending on the deployment model.

**Future Enhancements**

*   Integration with additional TTS engines and voice libraries.
*   Support for more input file formats.
*   Advanced features like automatic chapter detection and generation of audio summaries.
*   Cloud synchronization of audiobooks across multiple devices.

**Conclusion**

The TTS Audiobook Application aims to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for users who prefer to listen to books. By leveraging advanced TTS technology and focusing on user-friendly design, it offers a powerful tool for converting text into high-quality audiobooks.
