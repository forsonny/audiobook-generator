## Key Code Components with Example Implementations

This section outlines the key code components required for the TTS audiobook application, along with conceptual Python-based examples. These examples are illustrative and would need further refinement and integration with specific libraries and the Kokoro TTS API.

### 1. Text Parsing and Character Identification Algorithm

Text parsing involves extracting clean text from input files (epub, pdf, txt). Character identification aims to distinguish dialogue from narration and assign dialogue to specific characters.

**Text Parsing (Conceptual Example for TXT files):**

```python
# conceptual_parser.py

def parse_text_file(file_path):
    """Parses a plain text file and returns its content."""
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            text_content = f.read()
        # Further cleaning (e.g., removing excessive newlines) can be added here
        return text_content
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File not found at {file_path}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error parsing file {file_path}: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage:
# book_text = parse_text_file("my_book.txt")
```
For EPUB and PDF files, libraries like `EbookLib` and `PyPDF2` or `pdfminer.six` would be used respectively. The core idea is to extract the textual content and structure it into a processable format, perhaps a list of paragraphs or chapters.

**Dialogue and Narration Identification (Rule-Based Conceptual Example):**

```python
# conceptual_dialogue_identifier.py
import re

def identify_dialogue_and_narration(text_segments):
    """Identifies dialogue and narration in text segments using simple rules."""
    processed_segments = []
    # Regex to find common dialogue patterns (e.g., text within double quotes)
    dialogue_pattern = re.compile(r'"(.*?)"')

    for segment in text_segments:
        # This is a very simplified approach. Real-world scenarios are more complex.
        # A more robust solution would involve NLP techniques.
        is_dialogue = bool(dialogue_pattern.search(segment))
        segment_type = 'dialogue' if is_dialogue else 'narration'
        
        # Placeholder for actual character identification
        character_name = "Unknown Character" if is_dialogue else "Narrator"
        
        if is_dialogue:
            # Attempt to find a speaker tag immediately before or after the quote
            # Example: "Hello," she said. OR She said, "Hello."
            # This requires more sophisticated pattern matching or NLP coreference resolution
            pass # Add character identification logic here

        processed_segments.append({
            'text': segment.strip(),
            'type': segment_type,
            'speaker': character_name
        })
    return processed_segments

# Example usage:
# paragraphs = ["He looked up. \"What time is it?\" he asked.", "The clock on the wall showed midnight."]
# structured_text = identify_dialogue_and_narration(paragraphs)
# for item in structured_text:
#     print(f"{item['speaker']} ({item['type']}): {item['text']}")
```
Character identification is significantly more challenging. A simple rule-based approach might look for phrases like "X said," or rely on consistent dialogue attribution. Advanced methods would involve Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify character names and coreference resolution to link pronouns to these characters. User-assisted tagging will likely be essential for high accuracy.

### 2. Voice Assignment and Management System

This system allows users to assign specific Kokoro TTS voices to identified characters and the narrator, and manages these assignments.

```python
# conceptual_voice_manager.py

class VoiceAssignmentManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.character_voices = {}  # Maps character name to voice ID/parameters
        self.narrator_voice = None    # Voice ID/parameters for the narrator
        self.available_voices = []    # List of available Kokoro TTS voices

    def load_available_voices(self, kokoro_tts_interface):
        """Fetches available voices from the Kokoro TTS engine."""
        # This would interact with Kokoro TTS to get a list of voice names or IDs
        # self.available_voices = kokoro_tts_interface.get_voices()
        self.available_voices = ["VoiceA", "VoiceB", "VoiceC", "NarratorStandard"]

    def assign_voice_to_character(self, character_name, voice_id):
        if voice_id not in self.available_voices:
            print(f"Error: Voice '{voice_id}' not available.")
            return
        self.character_voices[character_name] = voice_id
        print(f"Assigned voice '{voice_id}' to character '{character_name}'.")

    def assign_narrator_voice(self, voice_id):
        if voice_id not in self.available_voices:
            print(f"Error: Voice '{voice_id}' not available.")
            return
        self.narrator_voice = voice_id
        print(f"Assigned voice '{voice_id}' to narrator.")

    def get_voice_for_speaker(self, speaker_name):
        if speaker_name == "Narrator":
            return self.narrator_voice or "DefaultNarratorVoice"
        return self.character_voices.get(speaker_name, "DefaultCharacterVoice")

# Example usage:
# voice_manager = VoiceAssignmentManager()
# voice_manager.load_available_voices(None) # Pass actual TTS interface
# voice_manager.assign_narrator_voice("NarratorStandard")
# voice_manager.assign_voice_to_character("Alice", "VoiceA")
# voice_manager.assign_voice_to_character("Bob", "VoiceB")
```
This system would be integrated with the UI to allow users to make these assignments. The `voice_id` could be a simple name or a more complex set of parameters for Kokoro TTS.

### 3. TTS Integration Code

This component handles communication with the Kokoro TTS engine, sending text and voice parameters, and receiving audio data.

```python
# conceptual_tts_integrator.py
# Assuming Kokoro TTS has a Python API or a CLI that can be wrapped.
# This is highly dependent on the actual Kokoro TTS interface.

class KokoroTTSInterface:
    def __init__(self, model_path):
        self.model_path = model_path
        # Initialize the Kokoro TTS model here
        # e.g., self.model = load_kokoro_model(model_path)
        print(f"Kokoro TTS model loaded from {model_path}")

    def synthesize_speech(self, text, voice_id, output_path):
        """Synthesizes speech for the given text using the specified voice."""
        print(f"Synthesizing: '{text[:50]}...' with voice '{voice_id}' to '{output_path}'")
        # Actual call to Kokoro TTS synthesis function
        # This might involve: 
        # 1. Preparing input (text, voice parameters)
        # 2. Calling model.generate(text, voice_config=voice_id)
        # 3. Saving the output audio to output_path
        # For demonstration, we'll just create a dummy file.
        try:
            with open(output_path, 'w') as f:
                f.write(f"Dummy audio for: {text} with voice {voice_id}")
            print(f"Successfully synthesized audio to {output_path}")
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during synthesis: {e}")
            return False

# Example usage:
# tts_engine = KokoroTTSInterface(model_path="./models/kokoro-82m")
# tts_engine.synthesize_speech("Hello world, this is a test.", "VoiceA", "output_segment1.wav")
```
The actual implementation will depend heavily on how Kokoro TTS is packaged and its API. If it's a Hugging Face model, the `transformers` library would likely be used. Error handling and asynchronous processing are critical here.

### 4. Audio File Generation and Management

This involves taking the synthesized audio segments (likely WAV files initially) and concatenating them into a final audiobook format (e.g., MP3, M4A), potentially adding chapter markers.

```python
# conceptual_audio_manager.py
from pydub import AudioSegment # Requires pydub and ffmpeg/libav
import os

def combine_audio_segments(segment_paths, output_filename, output_format="mp3"):
    """Combines multiple audio segments into a single audiobook file."""
    if not segment_paths:
        print("No audio segments to combine.")
        return None

    combined_audio = AudioSegment.empty()
    try:
        for path in segment_paths:
            if os.path.exists(path):
                # Assuming all segments are WAV initially from TTS
                segment_audio = AudioSegment.from_wav(path)
                combined_audio += segment_audio
            else:
                print(f"Warning: Audio segment not found at {path}")
        
        # Export to desired format
        output_file_path = f"{output_filename}.{output_format}"
        combined_audio.export(output_file_path, format=output_format)
        print(f"Audiobook successfully created at {output_file_path}")
        return output_file_path
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error combining audio segments: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage:
# audio_segments = ["output_segment1.wav", "output_segment2.wav"] # Paths to generated WAVs
# # Create dummy WAV files for the example to run
# with open("output_segment1.wav", "w") as f: f.write("dummy wav 1")
# with open("output_segment2.wav", "w") as f: f.write("dummy wav 2")
# # Need to ensure these are valid WAVs for pydub to work, or use placeholder logic
# # For now, this example will likely fail if pydub tries to parse non-WAVs.
# # The TTSInterface above should generate actual (even if silent) WAVs.

# # To make this runnable without real WAVs, we'd skip the actual pydub part:
# # print(f"Simulating audiobook creation at my_audiobook.mp3 from {audio_segments}")

# # Assuming valid WAVs are produced by the TTS step:
# # audiobook_path = combine_audio_segments(audio_segments, "my_audiobook")
```
This component would also manage temporary audio files, allow for playback of segments or the full book, and handle export options. Libraries like `pydub` (which requires `ffmpeg` or `libav`) are excellent for audio manipulation tasks such as concatenation, format conversion, and adding metadata. Careful management of file paths and temporary storage will be necessary.

These conceptual code components provide a starting point. The actual implementation will require significant development effort, thorough testing, and adaptation to the specific characteristics of the Kokoro TTS model and chosen libraries.
