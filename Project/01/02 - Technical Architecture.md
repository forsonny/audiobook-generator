## Technical Architecture

The application will be designed with a modular architecture to ensure flexibility and maintainability, comprising several key components that work in concert.

### 1. Frontend (Electron-based UI)

The frontend will be a cross-platform desktop application developed using Electron, which facilitates a single codebase for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The user interface itself will be constructed with modern web technologies, specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all operating within the Electron framework. It is envisioned to feature a clean and intuitive design, characterized by a left sidebar for primary navigation elements such as Library access, Settings configuration, and Current Project management. A central workspace will be dedicated to displaying the book's content and the ongoing status of the processing workflow. Complementing this, a right-hand panel will provide access to detailed configurations and settings for character voices.

Key functionalities of the frontend will include the capability to import files in various formats including EPUB, PDF, and TXT. Users will also benefit from text display and basic editing features. A crucial aspect will be the visualization of the audiobook generation process, offering clarity on stages like dialogue and narration identification, as well as voice assignment. Furthermore, the UI will provide controls for the TTS engine settings, allowing users to adjust voice selection, speed, and pitch. Finally, integrated audio playback and options for exporting the generated audiobook will be essential features.

### 2. Backend (Python)

The backend, implemented in Python, will serve as the application's core, handling all primary logic. This encompasses text processing, interaction with the TTS engine, and comprehensive file management.

Python scripts will be responsible for several text processing tasks. Initially, they will parse input files of various formats (EPUB, PDF, TXT) to extract the raw text content. This text will then undergo preprocessing, which includes cleaning, normalization, and segmentation into manageable units like sentences or paragraphs. A critical step in this pipeline is Dialogue and Narration Identification. To achieve this, several approaches can be explored: rule-based methods can identify dialogue based on common cues such as quotation marks and other punctuation; alternatively, Machine Learning models, potentially trained using scikit-learn or a more specialized NLP library, could be employed to classify text segments, though this would necessitate a labeled dataset. A hybrid approach, combining the strengths of rule-based systems with machine learning, may offer the most robust and accurate solution.

Following dialogue identification, Character Identification presents a more complex challenge. Initial strategies could involve heuristic-based methods, identifying speakers through patterns like "[Character Name] said," or by analyzing dialogue tags. More advanced techniques might incorporate Coreference Resolution, leveraging NLP to link pronouns and other referring expressions back to specific characters. Given the inherent difficulty, providing a user-assisted tagging mechanism, where users can manually tag or correct character assignments, will likely be crucial for achieving high accuracy.

Integration with the Kokoro TTS engine is another core backend responsibility. The application will need to interface with Kokoro TTS, potentially through a dedicated Python library if one exists, or by invoking its command-line interface if necessary. The specifics of this integration will depend heavily on the API and capabilities offered by Kokoro TTS. Voice Customization is a key user requirement, and the application will enable users to select different voices for various characters and the narrator. This will most likely be achieved by passing appropriate parameters to the Kokoro TTS engine. The backend will also manage the Audio Generation process, which involves sending processed text segments to Kokoro TTS and then receiving the generated audio data.

Finally, robust File Management will be handled by the backend. This includes managing input book files, any temporary files created during processing, and the final audiobook output, which will likely be in common formats such as MP3 or M4A. This also involves organizing project-specific files and efficiently managing storage space.

### 3. Data Management

Effective data management will be crucial for the application's operation. Each audiobook project will maintain its own set of associated files, encompassing the original book, the processed text, character voice assignments, and the generated audio segments. User Preferences, such as default voice choices and UI customization settings, will also need to be stored persistently. Additionally, the system will store Metadata for both books and the generated audiobooks, including details like title, author, and narrator information.

### 4. Error Handling and Logging

To ensure stability and maintainability, robust error handling will be implemented across all application operations, with particular attention paid to file input/output and interactions with the TTS engine. Furthermore, detailed logging mechanisms will be established. These logs will be invaluable for debugging issues, monitoring the application's performance, and diagnosing any problems that users might encounter.

## Development Tools and Technologies

The selection of appropriate development tools and technologies is critical for the successful implementation of this application. Python will serve as the primary programming language for the backend, chosen for its inherent strengths in text processing and the rich ecosystem of relevant libraries it offers. For the Electron-based frontend, JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS, will be the languages of choice.

Several frameworks and libraries will underpin the development. Electron itself is the core framework for building the cross-platform desktop application. On the Python backend, libraries such as `nltk` or `spaCy` will be utilized for sophisticated text processing and various NLP tasks, including sentence segmentation and tokenization. For audio manipulation tasks, if required beyond the capabilities of the TTS engine, libraries like `pydub` could be integrated. Specific libraries for interacting with Kokoro TTS will be necessary; if a direct Python binding is unavailable, the `subprocess` module can be used to manage command-line interactions. For the frontend development within Electron, while plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used for simpler UIs, adopting a JavaScript framework such as React, Vue, or Angular could provide better structure and maintainability for a more complex interface.

Version control will be managed using Git, ensuring a collaborative and organized development workflow. Finally, a comprehensive testing strategy will be employed. For the Python backend, testing frameworks like PyTest or the built-in `unittest` module will be used. The JavaScript frontend components will be tested using a suitable framework such as Jest or Mocha.
