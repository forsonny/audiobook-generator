## Step-by-Step Development Roadmap

Developing the TTS audiobook application will be an iterative process. This roadmap outlines the key phases and steps involved, from initial setup to a deployable application. This roadmap assumes a small to medium-sized development team or a dedicated solo developer.

**Phase 1: Foundation and Core Text Processing (Weeks 1-4)**

*   **Week 1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration.** This initial week will focus on setting up the development environment. This includes installing Python, Node.js, Electron, and any essential base libraries. A version control system (Git) repository will be initialized. Basic project structure for both frontend (Electron) and backend (Python) will be created. Initial research into the Kokoro TTS model's specific API and download procedures will also commence.
*   **Week 2-3: Basic Text Ingestion and Parsing.** The focus will shift to implementing the core text input functionalities. This involves developing modules to parse common book formats, starting with plain text (.txt) due to its simplicity, followed by EPUB. Libraries like `EbookLib` for EPUB will be integrated. The output should be a clean, structured representation of the book's content, perhaps as a list of paragraphs or sections. Basic UI elements for file import and text display in the Electron app will be stubbed out.
*   **Week 4: Initial Dialogue/Narration Segmentation.** Development of the first version of the dialogue and narration identification module will begin. This will likely start with a rule-based approach, focusing on identifying text enclosed in quotation marks and simple dialogue tags. The accuracy will be rudimentary at this stage, but it will provide a foundation for later refinement.

**Phase 2: TTS Integration and Basic Audio Generation (Weeks 5-8)**

*   **Week 5: Kokoro TTS Model Integration.** This week is dedicated to integrating the Kokoro TTS model. This includes downloading the model, writing Python scripts to load it, and successfully generating audio from simple text strings using a default voice. If Kokoro TTS has a command-line interface, wrappers will be developed; if it has a Python API, that will be used directly. Error handling for model loading and basic synthesis will be implemented.
*   **Week 6: Backend API for TTS and Voice Management.** A basic backend API (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI, or direct function calls if the backend is tightly coupled) will be developed to expose TTS functionality to the Electron frontend. This API will handle requests for text synthesis. Simultaneously, the foundational Voice Assignment Management system will be designed, allowing for at least one narrator voice and one character voice to be configured, even if not dynamically assigned yet.
*   **Week 7: Basic Audio Output and Playback.** The application will be enhanced to take the synthesized audio segments (likely WAV files) from Kokoro TTS and play them back within the Electron application. Functionality to save a single synthesized segment to a file will also be added. The focus is on proving the end-to-end audio generation pipeline for a small piece of text.
*   **Week 8: Linking Text Segments to Audio.** The system will be updated to process a sequence of text segments (e.g., paragraphs identified in Phase 1), synthesize each, and then concatenate them into a single audio file. Libraries like `pydub` will be integrated for audio concatenation and basic format conversion (e.g., to MP3). The UI will be updated to reflect the processing of multiple segments.

**Phase 3: Advanced NLP, Character Voices, and UI Refinement (Weeks 9-14)**

*   **Week 9-10: Advanced Character and Dialogue Identification.** The initial dialogue/narration identification module will be improved. This may involve incorporating more sophisticated NLP techniques (e.g., using `spaCy` or `NLTK` for better sentence boundary detection and POS tagging) or starting to explore machine learning models if a suitable labeled dataset can be created or found. The focus will also be on developing the character identification logic, moving beyond simple tags to more complex heuristics or NER.
*   **Week 11: Voice Customization UI and Backend Logic.** The UI will be developed to allow users to select from available Kokoro TTS voices (once known) and assign them to the narrator and identified characters. The Voice Assignment Manager backend will be fully implemented to store and retrieve these mappings per project. The TTS integration will be updated to use these selected voices.
*   **Week 12: UI/UX Enhancements based on Mockup.** Significant effort will be dedicated to refining the Electron UI to align more closely with the provided mockup. This includes implementing the three-panel layout (sidebar, main workspace, settings panel), visual representation of the processing pipeline, and ensuring a clean, modern aesthetic with good use of whitespace.
*   **Week 13: Handling PDF and Improving Robustness.** Support for PDF file ingestion will be added, using libraries like `PyPDF2` or `pdfminer.six`. This can be complex due to varied PDF structures. Robust error handling across the application (file parsing, TTS errors, etc.) will be improved, and comprehensive logging will be implemented.
*   **Week 14: Offline Functionality and Performance Optimization.** Ensure the application works fully offline after the initial Kokoro TTS model download. Begin performance profiling and optimization, particularly for large book processing and TTS generation. This might involve optimizing Python code, exploring batch processing for TTS if supported, and ensuring efficient memory usage.

**Phase 4: Testing, Refinement, and Packaging (Weeks 15-18)**

*   **Week 15-16: Alpha Testing and Feature Refinement.** Conduct internal alpha testing with various book formats and lengths. Gather feedback on usability, accuracy of dialogue/character identification, and audio quality. Refine features based on this feedback. Focus on improving the user-assisted correction mechanisms for dialogue and character assignments.
*   **Week 17: Documentation and Beta Preparation.** Prepare user documentation (e.g., a help guide within the app or a separate document). Finalize all UI text and ensure consistency. Prepare the application for a beta release, including creating installers for different operating systems using Electron builder tools.
*   **Week 18: Beta Testing and Bug Fixing.** Release a beta version to a small group of external testers if possible. Collect feedback and focus on fixing bugs and making final polishing touches. Address any critical performance issues identified.

**Post-Release: Maintenance and Future Enhancements**

*   Ongoing maintenance to fix bugs and ensure compatibility with OS updates.
*   Potential future enhancements could include: support for more TTS engines, advanced voice cloning features (if ethically and technically feasible), cloud synchronization of projects, integration with online book repositories, or more sophisticated ML-based character and emotion detection.

This roadmap is a guideline and can be adjusted based on development progress, team size, and the specific complexities encountered with the Kokoro TTS model and NLP tasks. Regular review and adaptation of the plan will be necessary.
