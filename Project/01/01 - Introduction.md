## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive technical plan for developing an advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) audiobook application. The application aims to convert books from various digital formats (epub, pdf, txt) into engaging audiobooks by leveraging sophisticated TTS technology, specifically the Kokoro TTS model. A key feature of this application will be its ability to differentiate between dialogue and narration, assign distinct voices to individual characters and the narrator, and provide users with options to customize these voices. The user interface (UI) will be a modern, clean Electron-based desktop application, drawing inspiration from the provided UI mockup, which emphasizes a clear workflow visualization, intuitive navigation, and easy configuration. This plan will detail the proposed technical architecture, the integration strategy for Kokoro TTS, example code components, potential challenges with their corresponding solutions, and a step-by-step development roadmap. The goal is to provide a clear path towards building a robust, user-friendly, and high-quality audiobook generation tool that functions offline after the initial setup and model download.


## Technical Architecture

The application will be designed with a modular architecture to ensure flexibility and maintainability, comprising several key components that work in concert.

### 1. Frontend (Electron-based UI)

The frontend will be a cross-platform desktop application developed using Electron, which facilitates a single codebase for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The user interface itself will be constructed with modern web technologies, specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all operating within the Electron framework. It is envisioned to feature a clean and intuitive design, characterized by a left sidebar for primary navigation elements such as Library access, Settings configuration, and Current Project management. A central workspace will be dedicated to displaying the book's content and the ongoing status of the processing workflow. Complementing this, a right-hand panel will provide access to detailed configurations and settings for character voices.

Key functionalities of the frontend will include the capability to import files in various formats including EPUB, PDF, and TXT. Users will also benefit from text display and basic editing features. A crucial aspect will be the visualization of the audiobook generation process, offering clarity on stages like dialogue and narration identification, as well as voice assignment. Furthermore, the UI will provide controls for the TTS engine settings, allowing users to adjust voice selection, speed, and pitch. Finally, integrated audio playback and options for exporting the generated audiobook will be essential features.

### 2. Backend (Python)

The backend, implemented in Python, will serve as the application's core, handling all primary logic. This encompasses text processing, interaction with the TTS engine, and comprehensive file management.

Python scripts will be responsible for several text processing tasks. Initially, they will parse input files of various formats (EPUB, PDF, TXT) to extract the raw text content. This text will then undergo preprocessing, which includes cleaning, normalization, and segmentation into manageable units like sentences or paragraphs. A critical step in this pipeline is Dialogue and Narration Identification. To achieve this, several approaches can be explored: rule-based methods can identify dialogue based on common cues such as quotation marks and other punctuation; alternatively, Machine Learning models, potentially trained using scikit-learn or a more specialized NLP library, could be employed to classify text segments, though this would necessitate a labeled dataset. A hybrid approach, combining the strengths of rule-based systems with machine learning, may offer the most robust and accurate solution.

Following dialogue identification, Character Identification presents a more complex challenge. Initial strategies could involve heuristic-based methods, identifying speakers through patterns like "[Character Name] said," or by analyzing dialogue tags. More advanced techniques might incorporate Coreference Resolution, leveraging NLP to link pronouns and other referring expressions back to specific characters. Given the inherent difficulty, providing a user-assisted tagging mechanism, where users can manually tag or correct character assignments, will likely be crucial for achieving high accuracy.

Integration with the Kokoro TTS engine is another core backend responsibility. The application will need to interface with Kokoro TTS, potentially through a dedicated Python library if one exists, or by invoking its command-line interface if necessary. The specifics of this integration will depend heavily on the API and capabilities offered by Kokoro TTS. Voice Customization is a key user requirement, and the application will enable users to select different voices for various characters and the narrator. This will most likely be achieved by passing appropriate parameters to the Kokoro TTS engine. The backend will also manage the Audio Generation process, which involves sending processed text segments to Kokoro TTS and then receiving the generated audio data.

Finally, robust File Management will be handled by the backend. This includes managing input book files, any temporary files created during processing, and the final audiobook output, which will likely be in common formats such as MP3 or M4A. This also involves organizing project-specific files and efficiently managing storage space.

### 3. Data Management

Effective data management will be crucial for the application's operation. Each audiobook project will maintain its own set of associated files, encompassing the original book, the processed text, character voice assignments, and the generated audio segments. User Preferences, such as default voice choices and UI customization settings, will also need to be stored persistently. Additionally, the system will store Metadata for both books and the generated audiobooks, including details like title, author, and narrator information.

### 4. Error Handling and Logging

To ensure stability and maintainability, robust error handling will be implemented across all application operations, with particular attention paid to file input/output and interactions with the TTS engine. Furthermore, detailed logging mechanisms will be established. These logs will be invaluable for debugging issues, monitoring the application's performance, and diagnosing any problems that users might encounter.

## Development Tools and Technologies

The selection of appropriate development tools and technologies is critical for the successful implementation of this application. Python will serve as the primary programming language for the backend, chosen for its inherent strengths in text processing and the rich ecosystem of relevant libraries it offers. For the Electron-based frontend, JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS, will be the languages of choice.

Several frameworks and libraries will underpin the development. Electron itself is the core framework for building the cross-platform desktop application. On the Python backend, libraries such as `nltk` or `spaCy` will be utilized for sophisticated text processing and various NLP tasks, including sentence segmentation and tokenization. For audio manipulation tasks, if required beyond the capabilities of the TTS engine, libraries like `pydub` could be integrated. Specific libraries for interacting with Kokoro TTS will be necessary; if a direct Python binding is unavailable, the `subprocess` module can be used to manage command-line interactions. For the frontend development within Electron, while plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used for simpler UIs, adopting a JavaScript framework such as React, Vue, or Angular could provide better structure and maintainability for a more complex interface.

Version control will be managed using Git, ensuring a collaborative and organized development workflow. Finally, a comprehensive testing strategy will be employed. For the Python backend, testing frameworks like PyTest or the built-in `unittest` module will be used. The JavaScript frontend components will be tested using a suitable framework such as Jest or Mocha.

## Integrating Kokoro TTS

Integrating the Kokoro TTS engine (specifically the 82M parameter version available on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) is a pivotal part of this application. The integration will focus on efficient model loading, robust API interaction, comprehensive voice customization, and optimized performance for generating high-quality audio.

### Loading and Using the Model Efficiently

The first step involves downloading the Kokoro TTS model files from Hugging Face. Since the application is designed to work offline after the initial setup, these model files will need to be stored locally. The application's backend, built in Python, will be responsible for loading this model. If Kokoro TTS is provided as a Python library (e.g., compatible with Hugging Face Transformers), loading would typically involve importing the necessary classes and using a `from_pretrained()` method, pointing to the local path where the model is saved. For instance, `model = AutoModelForTTS.from_pretrained("./models/kokoro-82m")` and `tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./models/kokoro-82m")`. Efficiency in loading can be achieved by loading the model once at application startup or when the TTS functionality is first invoked, and keeping it in memory for subsequent requests. This avoids the overhead of reloading the model for each text segment. If the model is large, consider memory management strategies, potentially offloading parts of the model to disk if not actively used, though for an 82M parameter model, it should be manageable in memory on most modern desktops.

### Required Setup and Configuration

The setup process will involve guiding the user to download the Kokoro TTS model during the application's first run or providing a settings panel where the path to the model can be configured. The application will need to verify the integrity and presence of the model files. Configuration options should include selecting the appropriate version of the model if multiple exist. The backend will need to handle any specific dependencies required by Kokoro TTS. This might involve installing specific Python packages (e.g., `transformers`, `torch`, `soundfile`) which should be listed in the application's `requirements.txt` file. The application should also check for hardware compatibility, such as available RAM and CPU capabilities, as TTS generation can be computationally intensive. While GPU acceleration can significantly speed up inference for larger models, the 82M parameter model might perform adequately on a CPU, but providing an option to leverage a GPU if available would be beneficial.

### Techniques for Voice Customization and Adjustment

Voice customization is a core requirement. Kokoro TTS, like many advanced TTS models, may offer several ways to customize voices. This could include selecting from a predefined set of voices within the model, or more advanced techniques like voice cloning (if supported and ethically permissible) or fine-tuning with specific voice data. For this application, the primary mechanism will be assigning different pre-available voices or voice characteristics (e.g., pitch, speed, emotional tone, if the model supports such parameters) to different characters and the narrator. The UI will present a list of available voices or adjustable parameters. The backend will then translate these user selections into the appropriate API calls or input parameters for the Kokoro TTS engine. For example, if Kokoro TTS accepts SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language), the backend could generate SSML tags to specify voice characteristics for different text segments: `<voice name="CharacterA">Dialogue text here.</voice> <voice name="Narrator">Narration text here.</voice>`. If direct parameter adjustment is supported, the API calls would include these parameters. The application should store these voice mappings per project, allowing users to maintain consistent character voices across an audiobook.

### Best Practices for Performance Optimization

Performance is crucial, especially when processing entire books. Several best practices should be implemented:
1.  **Batch Processing**: If Kokoro TTS supports batching multiple text segments for synthesis in a single call, this can significantly improve throughput compared to processing sentence by sentence.
2.  **Asynchronous Operations**: TTS generation should be performed as a background task to keep the UI responsive. Python's `asyncio` library or multi-threading can be used for this. The UI should display progress updates.
3.  **Caching**: If certain phrases or sentences are repeated, caching the generated audio for these segments can save processing time, although this might be less relevant for narrative text.
4.  **Efficient Audio Encoding**: Once the raw audio waveform is generated, it needs to be encoded into a common audio format (e.g., MP3, M4A). Using efficient libraries and appropriate encoding settings (bitrate, sample rate) will balance file size and quality.
5.  **Model Quantization/Pruning (Advanced)**: If performance on lower-end hardware is a major concern and the model supports it, techniques like model quantization (reducing the precision of model weights) or pruning (removing less important model parameters) could be explored, though this might trade off some audio quality and requires careful implementation.
6.  **Streamlined Data Flow**: Minimize data copying and ensure efficient data transfer between the text processing module, the TTS engine, and the audio output module. For instance, generated audio could be streamed directly to a file or an audio player component.

By carefully considering these aspects of Kokoro TTS integration, the application can provide a seamless and efficient experience for users creating high-quality, multi-voice audiobooks.
## Key Code Components with Example Implementations

This section outlines the key code components required for the TTS audiobook application, along with conceptual Python-based examples. These examples are illustrative and would need further refinement and integration with specific libraries and the Kokoro TTS API.

### 1. Text Parsing and Character Identification Algorithm

Text parsing involves extracting clean text from input files (epub, pdf, txt). Character identification aims to distinguish dialogue from narration and assign dialogue to specific characters.

**Text Parsing (Conceptual Example for TXT files):**

```python
# conceptual_parser.py

def parse_text_file(file_path):
    """Parses a plain text file and returns its content."""
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            text_content = f.read()
        # Further cleaning (e.g., removing excessive newlines) can be added here
        return text_content
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File not found at {file_path}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error parsing file {file_path}: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage:
# book_text = parse_text_file("my_book.txt")
```
For EPUB and PDF files, libraries like `EbookLib` and `PyPDF2` or `pdfminer.six` would be used respectively. The core idea is to extract the textual content and structure it into a processable format, perhaps a list of paragraphs or chapters.

**Dialogue and Narration Identification (Rule-Based Conceptual Example):**

```python
# conceptual_dialogue_identifier.py
import re

def identify_dialogue_and_narration(text_segments):
    """Identifies dialogue and narration in text segments using simple rules."""
    processed_segments = []
    # Regex to find common dialogue patterns (e.g., text within double quotes)
    dialogue_pattern = re.compile(r'"(.*?)"')

    for segment in text_segments:
        # This is a very simplified approach. Real-world scenarios are more complex.
        # A more robust solution would involve NLP techniques.
        is_dialogue = bool(dialogue_pattern.search(segment))
        segment_type = 'dialogue' if is_dialogue else 'narration'
        
        # Placeholder for actual character identification
        character_name = "Unknown Character" if is_dialogue else "Narrator"
        
        if is_dialogue:
            # Attempt to find a speaker tag immediately before or after the quote
            # Example: "Hello," she said. OR She said, "Hello."
            # This requires more sophisticated pattern matching or NLP coreference resolution
            pass # Add character identification logic here

        processed_segments.append({
            'text': segment.strip(),
            'type': segment_type,
            'speaker': character_name
        })
    return processed_segments

# Example usage:
# paragraphs = ["He looked up. \"What time is it?\" he asked.", "The clock on the wall showed midnight."]
# structured_text = identify_dialogue_and_narration(paragraphs)
# for item in structured_text:
#     print(f"{item['speaker']} ({item['type']}): {item['text']}")
```
Character identification is significantly more challenging. A simple rule-based approach might look for phrases like "X said," or rely on consistent dialogue attribution. Advanced methods would involve Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify character names and coreference resolution to link pronouns to these characters. User-assisted tagging will likely be essential for high accuracy.

### 2. Voice Assignment and Management System

This system allows users to assign specific Kokoro TTS voices to identified characters and the narrator, and manages these assignments.

```python
# conceptual_voice_manager.py

class VoiceAssignmentManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.character_voices = {}  # Maps character name to voice ID/parameters
        self.narrator_voice = None    # Voice ID/parameters for the narrator
        self.available_voices = []    # List of available Kokoro TTS voices

    def load_available_voices(self, kokoro_tts_interface):
        """Fetches available voices from the Kokoro TTS engine."""
        # This would interact with Kokoro TTS to get a list of voice names or IDs
        # self.available_voices = kokoro_tts_interface.get_voices()
        self.available_voices = ["VoiceA", "VoiceB", "VoiceC", "NarratorStandard"]

    def assign_voice_to_character(self, character_name, voice_id):
        if voice_id not in self.available_voices:
            print(f"Error: Voice '{voice_id}' not available.")
            return
        self.character_voices[character_name] = voice_id
        print(f"Assigned voice '{voice_id}' to character '{character_name}'.")

    def assign_narrator_voice(self, voice_id):
        if voice_id not in self.available_voices:
            print(f"Error: Voice '{voice_id}' not available.")
            return
        self.narrator_voice = voice_id
        print(f"Assigned voice '{voice_id}' to narrator.")

    def get_voice_for_speaker(self, speaker_name):
        if speaker_name == "Narrator":
            return self.narrator_voice or "DefaultNarratorVoice"
        return self.character_voices.get(speaker_name, "DefaultCharacterVoice")

# Example usage:
# voice_manager = VoiceAssignmentManager()
# voice_manager.load_available_voices(None) # Pass actual TTS interface
# voice_manager.assign_narrator_voice("NarratorStandard")
# voice_manager.assign_voice_to_character("Alice", "VoiceA")
# voice_manager.assign_voice_to_character("Bob", "VoiceB")
```
This system would be integrated with the UI to allow users to make these assignments. The `voice_id` could be a simple name or a more complex set of parameters for Kokoro TTS.

### 3. TTS Integration Code

This component handles communication with the Kokoro TTS engine, sending text and voice parameters, and receiving audio data.

```python
# conceptual_tts_integrator.py
# Assuming Kokoro TTS has a Python API or a CLI that can be wrapped.
# This is highly dependent on the actual Kokoro TTS interface.

class KokoroTTSInterface:
    def __init__(self, model_path):
        self.model_path = model_path
        # Initialize the Kokoro TTS model here
        # e.g., self.model = load_kokoro_model(model_path)
        print(f"Kokoro TTS model loaded from {model_path}")

    def synthesize_speech(self, text, voice_id, output_path):
        """Synthesizes speech for the given text using the specified voice."""
        print(f"Synthesizing: '{text[:50]}...' with voice '{voice_id}' to '{output_path}'")
        # Actual call to Kokoro TTS synthesis function
        # This might involve: 
        # 1. Preparing input (text, voice parameters)
        # 2. Calling model.generate(text, voice_config=voice_id)
        # 3. Saving the output audio to output_path
        # For demonstration, we'll just create a dummy file.
        try:
            with open(output_path, 'w') as f:
                f.write(f"Dummy audio for: {text} with voice {voice_id}")
            print(f"Successfully synthesized audio to {output_path}")
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during synthesis: {e}")
            return False

# Example usage:
# tts_engine = KokoroTTSInterface(model_path="./models/kokoro-82m")
# tts_engine.synthesize_speech("Hello world, this is a test.", "VoiceA", "output_segment1.wav")
```
The actual implementation will depend heavily on how Kokoro TTS is packaged and its API. If it's a Hugging Face model, the `transformers` library would likely be used. Error handling and asynchronous processing are critical here.

### 4. Audio File Generation and Management

This involves taking the synthesized audio segments (likely WAV files initially) and concatenating them into a final audiobook format (e.g., MP3, M4A), potentially adding chapter markers.

```python
# conceptual_audio_manager.py
from pydub import AudioSegment # Requires pydub and ffmpeg/libav
import os

def combine_audio_segments(segment_paths, output_filename, output_format="mp3"):
    """Combines multiple audio segments into a single audiobook file."""
    if not segment_paths:
        print("No audio segments to combine.")
        return None

    combined_audio = AudioSegment.empty()
    try:
        for path in segment_paths:
            if os.path.exists(path):
                # Assuming all segments are WAV initially from TTS
                segment_audio = AudioSegment.from_wav(path)
                combined_audio += segment_audio
            else:
                print(f"Warning: Audio segment not found at {path}")
        
        # Export to desired format
        output_file_path = f"{output_filename}.{output_format}"
        combined_audio.export(output_file_path, format=output_format)
        print(f"Audiobook successfully created at {output_file_path}")
        return output_file_path
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error combining audio segments: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage:
# audio_segments = ["output_segment1.wav", "output_segment2.wav"] # Paths to generated WAVs
# # Create dummy WAV files for the example to run
# with open("output_segment1.wav", "w") as f: f.write("dummy wav 1")
# with open("output_segment2.wav", "w") as f: f.write("dummy wav 2")
# # Need to ensure these are valid WAVs for pydub to work, or use placeholder logic
# # For now, this example will likely fail if pydub tries to parse non-WAVs.
# # The TTSInterface above should generate actual (even if silent) WAVs.

# # To make this runnable without real WAVs, we'd skip the actual pydub part:
# # print(f"Simulating audiobook creation at my_audiobook.mp3 from {audio_segments}")

# # Assuming valid WAVs are produced by the TTS step:
# # audiobook_path = combine_audio_segments(audio_segments, "my_audiobook")
```
This component would also manage temporary audio files, allow for playback of segments or the full book, and handle export options. Libraries like `pydub` (which requires `ffmpeg` or `libav`) are excellent for audio manipulation tasks such as concatenation, format conversion, and adding metadata. Careful management of file paths and temporary storage will be necessary.

These conceptual code components provide a starting point. The actual implementation will require significant development effort, thorough testing, and adaptation to the specific characteristics of the Kokoro TTS model and chosen libraries.
## Potential Challenges and Their Solutions

Developing a sophisticated TTS audiobook application presents several potential challenges. Addressing these proactively is crucial for the project's success. This section outlines key challenges and proposes solutions or mitigation strategies for each.

One of the most significant challenges lies in **accurate dialogue and narration identification**. Simply relying on quotation marks can be insufficient due to varied writing styles, nested dialogues, or dialogues not enclosed in quotes. A purely rule-based system might struggle with these complexities. To address this, a hybrid approach is recommended. This would involve starting with a robust rule-based system that handles common dialogue patterns and then augmenting it with machine learning. A text classification model could be trained on a labeled dataset of book excerpts to distinguish dialogue from narration with higher accuracy. Furthermore, providing a user interface for manual correction and refinement of the automated identification will be essential to achieve the desired quality, allowing users to override incorrect classifications.

Another critical challenge is **accurate character identification and assignment**. Determining which character is speaking, especially in scenes with multiple characters or when dialogue tags are implicit, is a complex Natural Language Understanding (NLU) task. Simple heuristics like looking for "[Character Name] said" will not cover all cases. Advanced NLP techniques, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify character names and coreference resolution to link pronouns and anaphora to their referents, will be necessary. However, even state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems are not perfect. Therefore, similar to dialogue identification, a user-assisted approach will be vital. The system can propose character assignments, and the user can then confirm or correct them. Building a character profile within the application that learns common speaking patterns or names associated with certain dialogue styles could also improve suggestions over time.

**Maintaining voice consistency for each character throughout a long audiobook** can also be problematic. TTS models, even advanced ones like Kokoro TTS, might introduce subtle variations in voice output depending on the input text's emotional context or prosody, if not carefully managed. Ensuring that a character sounds consistently like themselves across many chapters requires careful parameterization of the TTS engine for each voice. If Kokoro TTS supports detailed voice characteristic controls (e.g., pitch range, speaking rate, emotional inflection styles), these should be defined and consistently applied for each character. Storing these voice profiles and applying them rigorously is key. Regular testing with longer passages will be needed to identify and address any inconsistencies.

**Performance and resource management, especially when processing large books**, pose a considerable technical hurdle. Parsing entire books, performing complex NLP analyses, and generating hours of audio can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. To mitigate this, the application should be designed for efficient processing. This includes using optimized libraries for text processing and audio manipulation, implementing background processing for lengthy tasks like TTS synthesis to keep the UI responsive, and potentially breaking down large books into smaller chunks (e.g., chapters) for sequential processing. For TTS generation, batching requests to the Kokoro engine, if supported, can improve throughput. Careful memory management will also be important, especially if the Kokoro model itself is large or if many audio segments are held in memory simultaneously.

**Ensuring high-quality audio output and managing the Kokoro TTS model effectively** is another area of concern. The perceived quality of the audiobook heavily depends on the naturalness and clarity of the synthesized voices. This requires thorough testing of the Kokoro TTS model with diverse texts and voice settings. The initial download and setup of the Kokoro model (82M parameters) must be user-friendly, and the application needs to handle potential issues like corrupted model files or insufficient disk space. Providing clear instructions and error messages during setup is crucial. Furthermore, if the model has specific dependencies or hardware requirements (e.g., for GPU acceleration, though an 82M model might run well on CPU), these must be clearly communicated and managed by the application.

Finally, **creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface (UI/UX)** for a feature-rich application like this is a challenge in itself. Users need to easily import books, manage projects, identify and assign characters, customize voices, and control the generation process. The UI design, inspired by the provided mockup, should prioritize clarity, ease of navigation, and a non-overwhelming presentation of options. Iterative design, user testing, and feedback incorporation will be essential to refine the UI and ensure a positive user experience. The visual representation of the processing pipeline, as suggested in the mockup, can greatly help users understand the workflow.

By anticipating these challenges and planning appropriate solutions, the development process can be smoother, and the final application will be more robust, user-friendly, and capable of producing high-quality TTS audiobooks.
## Step-by-Step Development Roadmap

Developing the TTS audiobook application will be an iterative process. This roadmap outlines the key phases and steps involved, from initial setup to a deployable application. This roadmap assumes a small to medium-sized development team or a dedicated solo developer.

**Phase 1: Foundation and Core Text Processing (Weeks 1-4)**

*   **Week 1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration.** This initial week will focus on setting up the development environment. This includes installing Python, Node.js, Electron, and any essential base libraries. A version control system (Git) repository will be initialized. Basic project structure for both frontend (Electron) and backend (Python) will be created. Initial research into the Kokoro TTS model's specific API and download procedures will also commence.
*   **Week 2-3: Basic Text Ingestion and Parsing.** The focus will shift to implementing the core text input functionalities. This involves developing modules to parse common book formats, starting with plain text (.txt) due to its simplicity, followed by EPUB. Libraries like `EbookLib` for EPUB will be integrated. The output should be a clean, structured representation of the book's content, perhaps as a list of paragraphs or sections. Basic UI elements for file import and text display in the Electron app will be stubbed out.
*   **Week 4: Initial Dialogue/Narration Segmentation.** Development of the first version of the dialogue and narration identification module will begin. This will likely start with a rule-based approach, focusing on identifying text enclosed in quotation marks and simple dialogue tags. The accuracy will be rudimentary at this stage, but it will provide a foundation for later refinement.

**Phase 2: TTS Integration and Basic Audio Generation (Weeks 5-8)**

*   **Week 5: Kokoro TTS Model Integration.** This week is dedicated to integrating the Kokoro TTS model. This includes downloading the model, writing Python scripts to load it, and successfully generating audio from simple text strings using a default voice. If Kokoro TTS has a command-line interface, wrappers will be developed; if it has a Python API, that will be used directly. Error handling for model loading and basic synthesis will be implemented.
*   **Week 6: Backend API for TTS and Voice Management.** A basic backend API (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI, or direct function calls if the backend is tightly coupled) will be developed to expose TTS functionality to the Electron frontend. This API will handle requests for text synthesis. Simultaneously, the foundational Voice Assignment Management system will be designed, allowing for at least one narrator voice and one character voice to be configured, even if not dynamically assigned yet.
*   **Week 7: Basic Audio Output and Playback.** The application will be enhanced to take the synthesized audio segments (likely WAV files) from Kokoro TTS and play them back within the Electron application. Functionality to save a single synthesized segment to a file will also be added. The focus is on proving the end-to-end audio generation pipeline for a small piece of text.
*   **Week 8: Linking Text Segments to Audio.** The system will be updated to process a sequence of text segments (e.g., paragraphs identified in Phase 1), synthesize each, and then concatenate them into a single audio file. Libraries like `pydub` will be integrated for audio concatenation and basic format conversion (e.g., to MP3). The UI will be updated to reflect the processing of multiple segments.

**Phase 3: Advanced NLP, Character Voices, and UI Refinement (Weeks 9-14)**

*   **Week 9-10: Advanced Character and Dialogue Identification.** The initial dialogue/narration identification module will be improved. This may involve incorporating more sophisticated NLP techniques (e.g., using `spaCy` or `NLTK` for better sentence boundary detection and POS tagging) or starting to explore machine learning models if a suitable labeled dataset can be created or found. The focus will also be on developing the character identification logic, moving beyond simple tags to more complex heuristics or NER.
*   **Week 11: Voice Customization UI and Backend Logic.** The UI will be developed to allow users to select from available Kokoro TTS voices (once known) and assign them to the narrator and identified characters. The Voice Assignment Manager backend will be fully implemented to store and retrieve these mappings per project. The TTS integration will be updated to use these selected voices.
*   **Week 12: UI/UX Enhancements based on Mockup.** Significant effort will be dedicated to refining the Electron UI to align more closely with the provided mockup. This includes implementing the three-panel layout (sidebar, main workspace, settings panel), visual representation of the processing pipeline, and ensuring a clean, modern aesthetic with good use of whitespace.
*   **Week 13: Handling PDF and Improving Robustness.** Support for PDF file ingestion will be added, using libraries like `PyPDF2` or `pdfminer.six`. This can be complex due to varied PDF structures. Robust error handling across the application (file parsing, TTS errors, etc.) will be improved, and comprehensive logging will be implemented.
*   **Week 14: Offline Functionality and Performance Optimization.** Ensure the application works fully offline after the initial Kokoro TTS model download. Begin performance profiling and optimization, particularly for large book processing and TTS generation. This might involve optimizing Python code, exploring batch processing for TTS if supported, and ensuring efficient memory usage.

**Phase 4: Testing, Refinement, and Packaging (Weeks 15-18)**

*   **Week 15-16: Alpha Testing and Feature Refinement.** Conduct internal alpha testing with various book formats and lengths. Gather feedback on usability, accuracy of dialogue/character identification, and audio quality. Refine features based on this feedback. Focus on improving the user-assisted correction mechanisms for dialogue and character assignments.
*   **Week 17: Documentation and Beta Preparation.** Prepare user documentation (e.g., a help guide within the app or a separate document). Finalize all UI text and ensure consistency. Prepare the application for a beta release, including creating installers for different operating systems using Electron builder tools.
*   **Week 18: Beta Testing and Bug Fixing.** Release a beta version to a small group of external testers if possible. Collect feedback and focus on fixing bugs and making final polishing touches. Address any critical performance issues identified.

**Post-Release: Maintenance and Future Enhancements**

*   Ongoing maintenance to fix bugs and ensure compatibility with OS updates.
*   Potential future enhancements could include: support for more TTS engines, advanced voice cloning features (if ethically and technically feasible), cloud synchronization of projects, integration with online book repositories, or more sophisticated ML-based character and emotion detection.

This roadmap is a guideline and can be adjusted based on development progress, team size, and the specific complexities encountered with the Kokoro TTS model and NLP tasks. Regular review and adaptation of the plan will be necessary.
