## Responsive Behavior

While primarily designed for desktop use, the interface should adapt to different screen sizes:

1. **Desktop (1920Ã—1080 and larger)**
    
    - Full three-panel layout
    - Expanded workspace visualization
    - All features visible
2. **Laptop (1366Ã—768 to 1920Ã—1080)**
    
    - Three-panel layout with reduced padding
    - Slightly condensed components
    - Scrollable panels as needed
3. **Small Screens (below 1366px width)**
    
    - Collapsible side panels
    - Panel toggle buttons
    - Focus on one panel at a time when necessary
    - Preserved workflow visualization with zoom controls

## Accessibility Considerations

1. **Color Usage**
    
    - All information conveyed by color also has text or icon indicators
    - Sufficient contrast ratios for all text (WCAG AA compliant)
    - Alternative high-contrast theme available
2. **Keyboard Navigation**
    
    - Full keyboard accessibility for all interactions
    - Logical tab order through the interface
    - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
    - Focus indicators for keyboard navigation
3. **Screen Readers**
    
    - Proper ARIA labels for all interactive elements
    - Meaningful alt text for icons and visualizations
    - Logical heading structure
    - Status updates announced appropriately
4. **Text Scaling**
    
    - Interface handles text scaling up to 200%
    - No loss of functionality with larger text
    - Responsive layout adjustments for accessibility needs

## Animation and Transitions

Subtle animations provide feedback and enhance usability:

1. **State Changes**
    
    - Smooth transitions between button states (300ms)
    - Easing functions for natural movement
    - Progress animations for long-running processes
2. **Panel Transitions**
    
    - Smooth slide animations for panel expansion/collapse
    - Fade transitions for content changes
    - Subtle scale animations for selection states
3. **Workflow Visualization**
    
    - Animated data flow along connection paths
    - Progress animations within nodes
    - Smooth transitions when focusing on nodes

## Implementation Notes

1. **Frontend Technologies**
    
    - Electron with React for UI components
    - CSS modules or styled-components for styling
    - SVG for workflow visualization
    - Web Audio API for audio visualization
2. **Component Library**
    
    - Custom component library for consistent styling
    - Reusable components for common patterns
    - Theme provider for consistent colors and styling
    - Responsive grid system for layouts
3. **Performance Considerations**
    
    - Virtualized lists for large character/segment lists
