# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Book Import and Parsing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Enable users to import books in EPUB, PDF, and TXT formats, extract structured text with precise chapter and paragraph preservation, extract metadata, and create projects with the specified folder structure. The implementation must match the exact visual layout, components, and workflow shown in the book-import-screen.png mockup located in Project/UI Mockups/.
# Details:
Use Electron file dialogs for file selection and drag-and-drop, ensuring the UI matches the book-import-screen.png mockup in Project/UI Mockups/. Implement parsers for EPUB (epub.js or similar), PDF (pdf.js or PyPDF2), and TXT with UTF-8 encoding detection and handling. Extract metadata (title, author, publication date) and preserve structure (chapters, paragraphs) exactly as described in the Technical Specification for backend parser modules. Store parsed content in SQLite and local filesystem following the Project Data Structure for project creation. The UI must include the drag-and-drop area, book type selection, processing options, and recently added books section as shown in the mockup. The file selection dialog, supported formats display, and import button styling must be implemented exactly as shown in the mockup. Show progress and handle errors.

# Test Strategy:
Test import of sample files in each format with emphasis on UTF-8 encoding handling for TXT files. Verify metadata extraction (title, author, publication date), exact preservation of chapter boundaries and paragraph structure, adherence to backend parser file structure, and correct project folder creation. Validate error handling and progress reporting. Confirm that the UI, including drag-and-drop area, book type selection, processing options, recently added books section, file selection dialog, supported formats display, and import button styling, matches the book-import-screen.png mockup exactly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement file selection UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a user interface component that allows users to browse and select book files in EPUB, PDF, and TXT formats
### Details:
Implement file browser dialog, file type filtering, multiple file selection capability, and preview thumbnails. Include validation for supported file formats and file size limitations. The UI must match the layout and styling shown in book-import-screen.png in Project/UI Mockups/, including the drag-and-drop area, supported formats display, and import button styling.

## 2. Develop EPUB parser module [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a parser to extract content and structure from EPUB format books
### Details:
Implement EPUB archive extraction, XML/XHTML content parsing, CSS handling, image extraction, and table of contents mapping. Handle various EPUB versions (2.0, 3.0, 3.1) and implement error handling for malformed EPUB files. Ensure metadata extraction (title, author, publication date) and precise preservation of chapter and paragraph structure as per Technical Specification.

## 3. Develop PDF parser module [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a parser to extract text content, formatting, and structure from PDF documents
### Details:
Implement text extraction with proper reading order, handle embedded fonts, extract images, parse document structure (chapters, sections), and implement OCR fallback for scanned PDFs. Account for password-protected PDFs and various PDF versions. Extract metadata (title, author, publication date) and preserve chapter and paragraph boundaries exactly as specified.

## 4. Develop TXT parser module [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a parser to process plain text files with UTF-8 encoding detection and basic formatting detection
### Details:
Implement UTF-8 encoding detection and handling, basic structure inference (chapters, paragraphs), handle line breaks and whitespace normalization, and detect potential metadata from text patterns. Ensure precise preservation of chapter boundaries and paragraph structure.

## 5. Implement metadata extraction system [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Create a unified system to extract and normalize metadata from all supported file formats
### Details:
Extract title, author, publication date, ISBN, publisher, language, and cover images. Implement fallback strategies when metadata is missing, integrate with external metadata sources for enrichment, and normalize metadata across different formats. Ensure metadata extraction aligns with the Technical Specification.

## 6. Develop database storage implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Create a storage solution to save parsed books and their metadata in the database
### Details:
Design database schema for books, metadata, and content storage. Implement transaction handling for atomic imports, optimize for both search performance and storage efficiency, and create indexing for full-text search capabilities. Store parsed content and metadata following the Project Data Structure for project folder creation.
