# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Project Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable users to manage multiple audiobook projects, track progress, and handle project-specific settings according to the UI mockup specifications.
# Details:
Implement project creation, templates, and AI-powered genre/style detection (Gemini). Add library view with filtering, sorting, and search. Track processing history and API usage. Visual progress tracking. The implementation must match the exact visual layout and components shown in the UI mockup (Project/UI Mockups/ui-mockup.png), including the project overview screen with workflow visualization, progress tracking, settings panel, and status indicators.

# Test Strategy:
Test project creation, management, and progress tracking. Verify genre/style detection and library features. Ensure all UI elements match exactly with the ui-mockup.png specifications, including layout, components, and visual styling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Project Creation Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core functionality for creating new projects, including data models, user input forms, and validation logic.
### Details:
This subtask involves setting up the foundational data structures and interfaces required for users to initiate and define new projects, considering factors such as project name, description, team assignment, and initial settings. The UI must follow the exact layout and components shown in ui-mockup.png.

## 2. Template Implementation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop a system for applying and managing project templates to streamline project setup and ensure consistency.
### Details:
This includes creating reusable templates for common project types, integrating template selection into the project creation workflow, and allowing customization of template parameters. The template selection interface must match the design shown in ui-mockup.png.

## 3. Genre Detection Feature [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement AI-powered genre detection to automatically classify projects based on their content or metadata.
### Details:
Utilize machine learning or rule-based algorithms to analyze project data and assign a genre or category, enhancing organization and searchability. The genre detection UI components must match the mockup specifications.

## 4. Library View Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Create a comprehensive library view for browsing, filtering, and managing all projects within the system.
### Details:
Design and build a user interface that displays projects in a structured manner, supports advanced filtering (including by genre), and provides quick access to project details. The library view must exactly match the layout shown in ui-mockup.png, including all filtering options and visual elements.

## 5. Progress Tracking System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.4
### Description: Develop robust mechanisms for tracking project progress, milestones, and key performance indicators.
### Details:
Implement features such as progress bars, milestone checklists, and reporting dashboards to monitor and visualize project advancement over time. The progress tracking visualization must match exactly with the workflow diagram shown in ui-mockup.png, including all status indicators and progress elements.

## 6. API Usage Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5
### Description: Set up monitoring and analytics for all API interactions related to project management features.
### Details:
Track API calls, measure performance, log errors, and generate usage reports to ensure reliability and support future scaling or optimization.

## 7. Project Settings Panel Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement the project settings panel as shown in the UI mockup.
### Details:
Develop the settings panel exactly as displayed in ui-mockup.png, including all configuration options, toggles, and input fields. The panel must maintain the same visual styling, layout, and functionality as depicted in the mockup.

## 8. Workflow Visualization Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.5
### Description: Implement the workflow diagram visualization component shown in the mockup.
### Details:
Create the interactive workflow diagram exactly as shown in ui-mockup.png, including all nodes, connections, status indicators, and interactive elements. The visualization must accurately represent the project's current state and progress.

## 9. Processing Options Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.7
### Description: Implement the processing options interface as shown in the mockup.
### Details:
Develop all processing configuration options exactly as displayed in ui-mockup.png, including dropdown menus, sliders, checkboxes, and any other input controls. The layout and styling must match the mockup precisely.
