# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Character Identification and Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Identify characters, assign dialogue, and manage character profiles using Gemini API with fallback NLP system for offline operation. Implement UI according to character-voice-screen.png mockup.
# Details:
Integrate Gemini 2.0 Flash model for character detection, pronoun resolution, and alias merging. Implement CharacterAnalyzer service for deep character analysis. Structure character data in JSON format. Assign dialogue segments to characters. Create character registry with AI-generated profiles. Allow manual management in UI that exactly matches the character-voice-screen.png mockup in Project/UI Mockups/ directory, including character profile displays with initials, AI detection badges, confidence percentages, character statistics, descriptions, voice preview players, and parameter sliders.

# Test Strategy:
Test character detection and assignment on sample books. Verify manual management and profile generation match the mockup exactly. Test batch actions and voice library filtering system. Ensure fallback NLP system works when offline.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Character Detection System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a robust character detection system that identifies named entities and potential character references in text
### Details:
Implement NLP techniques to recognize character names, titles, and descriptive references. Include handling of capitalized proper nouns, character introductions, and contextual clues for unnamed characters. Consider using named entity recognition (NER) models with custom training for literary contexts.

## 2. Pronoun Resolution Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a module that accurately resolves pronouns to their respective character entities
### Details:
Develop algorithms for anaphora resolution that can handle complex pronoun references across paragraphs. Account for gender, number, and grammatical role when linking pronouns to characters. Implement confidence scoring for ambiguous cases that might require manual verification.

## 3. Alias Merging Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build a system to identify and merge different aliases, nicknames, and references to the same character
### Details:
Create similarity metrics and contextual analysis tools to determine when different names refer to the same entity. Handle diminutives, titles, and relationship-based references (e.g., 'his mother'). Implement both rule-based and machine learning approaches for optimal accuracy.

## 4. Dialogue Assignment Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Develop functionality to accurately assign dialogue to the correct speaking characters
### Details:
Create pattern recognition for dialogue markers and speaker attribution. Handle implicit speakers, conversation flow, and interruptions. Integrate with the pronoun resolution and character detection systems to maintain consistency in speaker identification throughout extended dialogues.

## 5. Character Profile Generator [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Implement a system that compiles comprehensive character profiles from detected information
### Details:
Aggregate character information including attributes, relationships, dialogue patterns, and narrative importance. Design data structures to store character hierarchies and relationships. Include extraction of character traits, motivations, and development arcs from contextual analysis. Ensure profiles include dialogue line counts and other statistics shown in the character-voice-screen.png mockup.

## 6. Manual Management UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Design and implement a user interface for manual review and editing of character information
### Details:
Create an intuitive interface for reviewing automated character detection results and making corrections. Implement the exact visual layout and components shown in character-voice-screen.png mockup, including character profile display with initials, AI detection badges, confidence percentages, character statistics (dialogue lines), character description, voice preview players, and voice parameter sliders. Include batch actions section and voice library filtering system as shown in the mockup.

## 7. Gemini API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate Gemini 2.0 Flash model for character analysis with structured JSON output
### Details:
Implement API calls to Gemini 2.0 Flash model for character detection and analysis. Create _build_character_prompt function to format requests properly. Handle API responses and parse JSON structure for character data. Implement error handling and rate limiting according to Gemini API guidelines.

## 8. CharacterAnalyzer Service Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.7
### Description: Develop the CharacterAnalyzer service for deep character analysis on book text
### Details:
Create a service that processes book text to extract comprehensive character information. Implement methods for character role identification, relationship inference, and personality trait extraction. Ensure the service can handle large text volumes by processing in manageable chunks.

## 9. Character Merging Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.7, 9.8
### Description: Implement logic to handle the same character identified across different contexts
### Details:
Develop algorithms to identify when different character references point to the same entity. Create confidence scoring for potential matches and implement merge operations that preserve all relevant character data. Handle edge cases like unreliable narrators or intentionally ambiguous character identities.

## 10. Fallback NLP System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Implement a fallback NLP system for offline character analysis operation
### Details:
Develop a local NLP pipeline that can perform basic character identification and dialogue attribution when Gemini API is unavailable. Optimize for performance on limited hardware. Create seamless switching between online and offline modes with appropriate user notification.

## 11. Character Relationship Inference [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.8, 9.9
### Description: Implement methods for inferring relationships between characters
### Details:
Develop algorithms to detect and categorize relationships between characters based on dialogue, narrative context, and explicit statements. Create a relationship graph data structure to represent character connections. Include confidence scoring for inferred relationships and support for complex relationship types.

## 12. Voice Preview Player Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.6
### Description: Implement voice preview players for character profiles as shown in the mockup
### Details:
Develop audio playback functionality for character voice samples. Implement play/pause controls and progress indicators as shown in the character-voice-screen.png mockup. Ensure seamless integration with the character profile display.

## 13. Voice Parameter Sliders [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.6, 9.12
### Description: Implement adjustable voice parameter sliders as shown in the mockup
### Details:
Create interactive sliders for adjusting voice parameters such as pitch, speed, and other voice characteristics. Ensure real-time preview updates when parameters are changed. Match the exact visual style shown in the character-voice-screen.png mockup.

## 14. Batch Actions Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.6
### Description: Implement batch action functionality for character management
### Details:
Develop batch selection and action capabilities for efficient character management. Implement all batch actions shown in the character-voice-screen.png mockup, including multi-select, bulk editing, and batch processing options. Ensure the UI matches the mockup exactly.

## 15. Voice Library Filtering System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.6, 9.12
### Description: Implement the voice library filtering system shown in the mockup
### Details:
Create a comprehensive filtering system for the voice library as shown in the character-voice-screen.png mockup. Implement filter categories, search functionality, and sorting options. Ensure the filtering UI and behavior match the mockup exactly.
