# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Gemini API Integration for Text Analysis
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Google Gemini API for advanced text analysis, character identification, and dialogue detection.
# Details:
Implement API client for Gemini. Add endpoints for character identification, dialogue detection, and contextual analysis. Use local NLP (spaCy/NLTK) as fallback. Cache API responses for efficiency.

# Test Strategy:
Test API integration with sample text. Verify character and dialogue detection accuracy. Test fallback to local NLP.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Gemini API Client [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the Gemini API client, including authentication, request handling, and response processing. Ensure secure storage of the API key and follow best practices for error handling and logging.
### Details:
Register for an API key, securely store it, and initialize the Gemini API client using the appropriate SDK. Implement robust error handling, retries, and logging as recommended in the documentation.

## 2. Develop Character Identification Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create an endpoint that leverages the Gemini API to identify characters from input data.
### Details:
Design the endpoint to accept relevant input, call the Gemini API for character identification, and return structured results. Ensure proper request formatting and response parsing.

## 3. Develop Dialogue Detection Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create an endpoint that uses the Gemini API to detect dialogue within input data.
### Details:
Design the endpoint to process input, interact with the Gemini API for dialogue detection, and return results in a consistent format. Handle errors and edge cases appropriately.

## 4. Implement Fallback NLP Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Develop local NLP-based fallback logic for character identification and dialogue detection in case the Gemini API is unavailable.
### Details:
Integrate open-source or custom NLP models to provide basic character identification and dialogue detection when API calls fail or rate limits are reached.

## 5. Integrate Response Caching Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Implement a caching layer to store and retrieve Gemini API responses for repeated requests, reducing latency and API usage.
### Details:
Design and implement a cache (e.g., in-memory or persistent) keyed by request parameters. Ensure cache invalidation and consistency with API updates.
