# Task ID: 4
# Title: Integrate Kokoro TTS Model
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Download, initialize, and integrate the Kokoro TTS model for local text-to-speech conversion with support for custom voices and streaming functionality.
# Details:
Download the Kokoro TTS model (hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) from Hugging Face and set up for local deployment. Implement Docker container integration with FastAPI for REST API architecture. Support both GPU and CPU implementations, voice customization parameters (pitch, speed, energy), and streaming TTS functionality for previewing.

# Test Strategy:
Test model download, initialization, and basic TTS synthesis with sample text. Verify audio output quality with multiple voice options including AFSky and AFSarah. Test both GPU and CPU modes, custom voice blending, and streaming functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Model Download and Initialization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Download the required TTS model files and initialize the TTS engine or SDK, ensuring all dependencies and environment variables are set up for the chosen provider.
### Details:
This includes setting up authentication, configuring API keys or credentials, and verifying that the model loads correctly in the runtime environment.

## 2. Text Normalization Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop and integrate a text normalization module to preprocess input text, handling punctuation, numbers, abbreviations, and other linguistic variations to improve synthesis quality.
### Details:
Ensure the normalization process is compatible with the requirements of the TTS model and supports the expected input formats.

## 3. Basic Synthesis Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement the core functionality to convert normalized text into speech using the initialized TTS model, and output the resulting audio.
### Details:
This includes handling API calls or SDK methods for synthesis, managing audio output, and basic error handling.

## 4. Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Optimize the TTS integration for performance by implementing caching, efficient resource management, and minimizing latency during synthesis.
### Details:
Analyze bottlenecks, apply caching strategies for repeated requests, and ensure the system scales efficiently under load.

## 5. Environment Setup with PyTorch and CUDA [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the required environment with PyTorch and specific CUDA versions to support Kokoro TTS model.
### Details:
Install PyTorch with appropriate CUDA support for GPU acceleration. Ensure compatibility with the Kokoro-82M model requirements. Configure fallback to CPU mode when GPU is not available.

## 6. Docker Container and FastAPI Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.5
### Description: Set up Kokoro FastAPI using Docker for both CPU and GPU implementations.
### Details:
Create Docker container configuration for Kokoro TTS. Implement FastAPI endpoints for text-to-speech conversion. Configure Docker authentication process and ensure proper container integration.

## 7. Voice Customization Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Implement support for voice customization parameters including pitch, speed, and energy.
### Details:
Add API parameters for adjusting voice characteristics. Support multiple voice options including AFSky and AFSarah. Implement voice blending functionality for custom voice creation.

## 8. Streaming TTS Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.6
### Description: Implement streaming TTS functionality for real-time audio preview.
### Details:
Create streaming endpoint in the FastAPI implementation. Ensure low-latency audio streaming for preview purposes. Handle connection management and error cases during streaming.
