# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Audio File Management and Export
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Manage, concatenate, and export audio segments into complete audiobooks, supporting advanced export formats, metadata, and batch processing. The implementation must match the exact visual layout and components shown in export-screen.png (located in Project/UI Mockups/). This includes the audiobook chapters listing with duration and status indicators, export format selection, audio quality options, metadata fields, advanced options toggles, the file details panel, and export/save buttons as depicted in the mockup.
# Details:
Use PyDub/FFmpeg to concatenate audio segments into chapters and full audiobooks. Normalize volume, add chapter markers (including M4B support), and export in MP3, M4B, WAV, and OGG formats. Embed metadata (title, author, cover art, etc.) in exported files. Implement file size optimization options as described in the technical specification. Provide customizable export settings for sample rate, bit depth, and compression profiles. Implement batch export functionality with progress reporting. Implement playback for segments, chapters, and full audiobooks. The export screen UI must match export-screen.png in Project/UI Mockups/, including: audiobook chapters listing with duration and status indicators, export format selection, audio quality options, metadata fields, advanced options toggles, file details panel, and export/save buttons.

# Test Strategy:
Test concatenation, export, and playback of sample audiobooks. Verify chapter markers (including M4B compatibility), metadata embedding, and export in all supported formats (MP3, M4B, WAV, OGG). Test file size optimization, customizable export settings, and batch export with progress reporting. Confirm that the export screen UI matches export-screen.png in Project/UI Mockups/ in all visual and interactive aspects, including chapters listing, export format selection, audio quality options, metadata fields, advanced options toggles, file details panel, and export/save buttons.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Audio Segment Concatenation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop functionality to join multiple audio segments into a single continuous file while preserving audio quality
### Details:
Create methods to handle different audio formats, ensure seamless transitions between segments, implement error handling for incompatible formats, and optimize for memory efficiency when dealing with large audio files

## 2. Develop Volume Normalization System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create a system to analyze and adjust volume levels across all audio segments to ensure consistent listening experience
### Details:
Implement RMS or LUFS analysis algorithms, create configurable normalization targets, develop preview functionality, and ensure processing doesn't introduce artifacts or distortion

## 3. Build Chapter Marker Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Design and implement a system for adding, editing, and managing chapter markers within the audio file, including M4B compatibility
### Details:
Create data structures to store chapter metadata, develop UI components for marker visualization and editing, implement timestamp validation, and ensure markers are preserved during export to compatible formats, including M4B files

## 4. Create Export Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Develop comprehensive export capabilities supporting multiple audio formats with metadata embedding, file size optimization, and customizable export settings
### Details:
Implement FFmpeg integration for format conversion supporting MP3, M4B, WAV, and OGG. Ensure chapter markers (including M4B), metadata (title, author, cover art, etc.), and file size optimization options are properly handled. Provide customizable export settings for sample rate, bit depth, and compression profiles. Implement batch export functionality with progress reporting. The export screen UI must match export-screen.png in Project/UI Mockups/, including: audiobook chapters listing with duration and status indicators, export format selection, audio quality options, metadata fields, advanced options toggles, file details panel, and export/save buttons.

## 5. Implement Playback Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.3
### Description: Build audio playback functionality with transport controls, visualization, and chapter navigation
### Details:
Develop transport controls (play, pause, seek), create waveform visualization, implement chapter-based navigation, add playback speed controls, and ensure accurate timestamp display during playback

## 6. Implement Export Screen UI as per Mockup [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Develop the export screen UI to match export-screen.png in Project/UI Mockups/ exactly, including all visual layout and components.
### Details:
Ensure the export screen includes: audiobook chapters listing with duration and status indicators, export format selection, audio quality options, metadata fields, advanced options toggles, file details panel, and export/save buttons, all matching the mockup in layout and functionality.
