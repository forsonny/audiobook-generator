# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Comprehensive UI Design System Matching Provided Mockups
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a complete UI design system that precisely matches the provided mockups, including color scheme, layout, typography, iconography, and all visual elements. Create reusable components for all UI elements to ensure consistency across the application. Developers must directly reference the UI mockup images located in the Project/UI Mockups/ directory during implementation. Each screen and component must be compared against these exact images for visual accuracy. The following mockups must be referenced for their respective interfaces:

- book-import-screen.png: Book import interface
- character-voice-screen.png: Character voice assignment interface
- export-screen.png: Audiobook export interface
- text-editor-screen.png: Text editor and dialogue detection interface
- ui-mockup.png: Project overview and general UI elements

Pixel-perfect implementation is required, including exact colors, spacing, typography, and component styling as depicted in these mockups.
# Details:
Begin by analyzing the provided mockups in the Project/UI Mockups/ directory to extract the exact color palette (with emphasis on the green scheme), spacing, layout grid, typography styles, iconography, and all visual elements. For each interface, developers must reference the corresponding mockup image:

- book-import-screen.png for the book import interface
- character-voice-screen.png for the character voice assignment interface
- export-screen.png for the audiobook export interface
- text-editor-screen.png for the text editor and dialogue detection interface
- ui-mockup.png for the project overview and general UI elements

Implement a card-based layout with rounded corners, ensuring all components (buttons, cards, toggles, dropdowns, etc.) are built as reusable, modular components in the chosen framework. Use design tokens to standardize colors, spacing, and typography for maintainability and scalability. Document each component with usage guidelines and examples, referencing the relevant mockup image for visual comparison. Collaborate closely with designers to resolve ambiguities and ensure pixel-perfect fidelity to the mockups. Ensure the system is flexible enough for future expansion but enforces strict visual consistency throughout the application. Integrate the design system into the existing three-panel UI structure from Task 2. Provide comprehensive documentation and onboarding materials for developers and designers, explicitly instructing them to use the mockup images as the baseline for all visual decisions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that every visual and interactive element in the application matches the provided mockups exactly in terms of color, spacing, layout, and style by directly comparing the implementation to the corresponding images in the Project/UI Mockups/ directory. Use pixel-by-pixel comparison tools to ensure fidelity. Test all reusable components in isolation (e.g., via Storybook) and within the application context to confirm consistency and correct behavior. Review documentation for completeness and clarity, ensuring each component's documentation references the relevant mockup image. Conduct usability testing with team members to ensure the system is easy to use and enforces consistency. Confirm that new UI elements can be built using only the provided components and tokens, maintaining the intended visual hierarchy and style as depicted in the mockups.
