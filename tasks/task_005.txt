# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Basic TTS Audio Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Generate speech audio from text segments using Kokoro TTS and assigned voice parameters, with enhanced text editing and audio visualization features. The implementation must match the exact visual layout and components shown in Project/UI Mockups/text-editor-screen.png. This includes the text editor with dialogue highlighting, character attribution tags, AI confidence percentages, chapter navigation, and text analysis panel. The waveform visualization, pagination controls, and editing tools must be implemented exactly as shown in the mockup.
# Details:
Implement batch processing of text segments. Apply voice parameters (pitch, speed, style) to TTS output. Store generated audio segments in local filesystem. Add progress indication. Integrate drag-and-drop chapter ordering functionality. Implement text highlighting for selected text. Support split-view editing mode with synchronized text and waveform views. Add automatic paragraph detection and formatting. Include support for custom CSS styling of the text editor. Implement find/replace functionality with regex support. Add support for custom user annotations. All UI and interaction must match the layout and components in Project/UI Mockups/text-editor-screen.png, including dialogue highlighting, character attribution tags, AI confidence percentages, chapter navigation, text analysis panel, waveform visualization, pagination controls, and editing tools.

# Test Strategy:
Test batch TTS generation with different voice parameters. Verify audio files are generated and stored correctly. Test drag-and-drop chapter ordering functionality. Verify text highlighting works correctly. Test split-view editing mode synchronization. Verify automatic paragraph detection. Test custom CSS styling application. Verify find/replace with regex support. Test custom user annotations functionality. Confirm that all UI elements and interactions match Project/UI Mockups/text-editor-screen.png, including dialogue highlighting, character attribution tags, AI confidence percentages, chapter navigation, text analysis panel, waveform visualization, pagination controls, and editing tools.
