# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Dialogue and Narration Identification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Distinguish between dialogue and narration using Gemini API and rule-based methods.
# Details:
Implement hybrid approach (Gemini + rule-based) for dialogue detection. Segment text into dialogue and narration. Allow manual correction in UI. Feed corrections back to Gemini for improvement. Use context-aware dialogue detection with multi-pass analysis for longer texts. Handle complex literary techniques and integrate with character identification system. Implement offline NLP fallback pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
Test dialogue/narration segmentation on sample books. Verify manual correction and feedback loop. Test handling of complex literary techniques including internal monologues and nested quotations. Validate integration with character identification system. Verify offline processing capabilities.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Gemini API Integration for Dialogue Identification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate the Gemini API to enable AI-driven dialogue identification, leveraging its NLP capabilities for initial detection and classification of dialogue segments.
### Details:
Set up authentication, configure endpoints, and ensure the API can process text inputs for dialogue identification tasks. Implement context-aware dialogue detection using Gemini's multi-turn conversation capabilities. Use the GenerativeModel class with appropriate model version (gemini-2.0-flash) for optimal performance.

## 2. Rule-Based Dialogue Detection Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop and implement rule-based methods to complement AI-driven dialogue identification, focusing on explicit patterns and linguistic cues.
### Details:
Design rules for speaker turns, punctuation, and dialogue markers to enhance or validate AI predictions. Implement specific dialogue classification algorithms based on quotation marks, surrounding context, and dialogue attributions. Add support for detecting complex literary techniques like internal monologues and nested quotations.

## 3. Text Segmentation for Dialogue Units [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Segment input text into discrete dialogue units, preparing data for both AI and rule-based processing.
### Details:
Implement algorithms to split text into sentences, utterances, or speaker turns as required by downstream modules. Implement multi-pass analysis approach for handling longer texts, with initial segmentation followed by detailed analysis of each segment.

## 4. UI for Manual Corrections of Dialogue Segmentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Develop a user interface that allows manual review and correction of dialogue segmentation results.
### Details:
Design UI components for displaying segmented dialogues, enabling users to adjust boundaries and labels as needed.

## 5. Feedback Loop Implementation for Continuous Improvement [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Implement a feedback mechanism to capture user corrections and improve both AI and rule-based models over time.
### Details:
Design data pipelines to collect corrections, retrain models, and update rules based on user feedback.

## 6. Character Identification System Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Integrate with the character identification system to properly attribute dialogue to specific characters.
### Details:
Develop interfaces to connect dialogue segments with character entities. Implement logic to associate dialogue with speakers based on context and explicit attributions. Update the dialogue model to include character references.

## 7. Offline NLP Fallback Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement a fallback NLP pipeline for offline processing when Gemini API is unavailable.
### Details:
Develop a local NLP solution using open-source libraries that can process text when cloud services are unavailable. Implement seamless switching between online and offline modes. Ensure consistent dialogue identification results between both processing methods.

## 8. Complex Literary Techniques Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Enhance the dialogue detection system to handle complex literary techniques beyond standard dialogue.
### Details:
Implement specialized detection for internal monologues, stream of consciousness, nested quotations, and other non-standard dialogue forms. Train Gemini with examples of these literary techniques to improve recognition accuracy.
