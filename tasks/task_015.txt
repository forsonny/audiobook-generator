# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Offline Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable core functionality (text processing, Kokoro TTS, audio export) to work offline after initial setup.
# Details:
Cache models and required data during initial setup. Implement fallback for Gemini-dependent features. Test offline operation.

# Test Strategy:
Test application operation without internet connection. Verify fallback and offline features.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Model Caching System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a caching system for application models to ensure they're available offline
### Details:
Create a robust caching mechanism that stores essential application models locally. This should include determining which models are critical for core functionality, implementing storage strategies that optimize for space and performance, and establishing cache invalidation policies for when connectivity is restored.

## 2. Develop Offline Data Storage Solution [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a local database architecture that supports offline operations and data persistence
### Details:
Implement a local database system that can store user data, application state, and necessary content. This should include schema design, CRUD operations that work without connectivity, and consideration for storage limitations on mobile devices. Focus on providing a seamless experience where users can access and modify their data regardless of connection status.

## 3. Build Fallback Mechanisms for Online Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Develop graceful degradation strategies for features that typically require connectivity
### Details:
Identify features that normally require online connectivity and create fallback implementations. This includes designing alternative UX flows, implementing placeholder content, queuing actions for later execution, and providing clear feedback to users about limited functionality while maintaining core app usability.

## 4. Create Data Synchronization System [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Develop a robust synchronization mechanism to reconcile local and server data when connectivity is restored
### Details:
Build a bidirectional synchronization system that handles conflict resolution, manages data integrity, and efficiently updates both local and server databases. This should include tracking changes made offline, implementing retry mechanisms for failed syncs, and ensuring data consistency across devices.

## 5. Implement Connectivity Detection and Mode Switching [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3, 15.4
### Description: Create a system to detect network status changes and seamlessly transition between online and offline modes
### Details:
Develop reliable connectivity monitoring that can detect network status changes and trigger appropriate application behaviors. This includes implementing event listeners for connectivity changes, creating smooth transitions between modes without disrupting user experience, and providing clear indicators of current connectivity status to users.
