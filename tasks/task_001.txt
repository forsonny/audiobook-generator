# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with Electron, React/Vue, Python, and required dependencies.
# Details:
Create a new repository with a README, .gitignore, and basic structure for Electron (frontend) and Python (backend). Install Node.js, Python 3.8+, and required libraries (Flask/FastAPI, spaCy/NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers, PyDub, FFmpeg, SQLite). Set up a basic build and run script for both frontend and backend.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository structure, successful installation of dependencies, and ability to run a basic Electron app and Python server.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Frontend Initialization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the frontend framework (React or Vue) within the Electron project, initializing the project structure and configuration files.
### Details:
Use Vue CLI or Create React App to scaffold the frontend. Integrate with Electron using plugins or manual configuration as needed.

Frontend initialization completed using native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simplicity and rapid prototyping. The structure includes:
- Main Electron entry point (src/main.js) for application lifecycle management.
- Preload script (src/preload.js) to facilitate secure IPC communication between the main and renderer processes.
- Basic HTML UI (src/index.html) implementing the card-based layout and green color scheme as per the mockups.
- CSS styling (src/styles.css) with CSS variables for consistent theming and maintainability.
- Renderer JavaScript (src/renderer.js) handling UI interactions and initializing the card-based interface.

The setup avoids framework overhead for the initial phase, focusing on modular organization and adherence to the provided UI mockups. This approach allows for straightforward integration with a frontend framework (React or Vue) in future iterations, if needed.

## 2. Backend Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Configure the backend component (e.g., Python or Node.js), ensuring it can communicate with the Electron frontend.
### Details:
Set up the backend server, define API endpoints, and establish IPC or HTTP communication between Electron and the backend.

<update><timestamp>2025-05-12T01:28:26Z</timestamp><content>The backend has been successfully configured using FastAPI, a modern Python web framework known for its speed and ease of use. The main application file (src/backend/app.py) initializes the FastAPI server and defines core API endpoints for book import, character analysis, audio generation, and project management. These endpoints are designed to facilitate seamless communication with the Electron frontend via HTTP requests. The backend architecture is modular, with dedicated service files for TTS (src/backend/tts_service.py, integrating Kokoro TTS) and AI text analysis (src/backend/gemini_service.py, leveraging Gemini models). All required Python dependencies are listed in src/backend/requirements.txt, ensuring a reproducible development environment. The codebase is structured for extensibility, with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling mechanisms in place. This setup supports future integration of additional services and features as the project evolves.</content></update>

## 3. Dependency Installation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Install all required dependencies for both frontend and backend, including Electron, framework libraries, and any additional packages.
### Details:
Use npm, yarn, or pip to install dependencies such as electron, electron-is-dev, and any UI libraries or backend packages.

## 4. Build Script Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Create and configure build scripts for development and production, ensuring proper build and launch of both frontend and backend components.
### Details:
Add or modify scripts in package.json or equivalent to handle building, serving, and packaging the application for different environments.

## 5. Testing Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Set up testing frameworks and configuration for both frontend and backend, enabling automated and manual testing.
### Details:
Integrate testing tools (e.g., Jest, Mocha, Pytest), configure test scripts, and ensure tests can run in the Electron environment.
